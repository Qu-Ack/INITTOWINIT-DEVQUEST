Proof of Concept for Health Analysis and Evaluation System
TEAM : INIT TO WIN IT
18 January 2025
1 Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a health analysis and evaluation system leveraging image and video analysis
techniques to assess facial and nail characteristics. The system will assist Ayurveda experts in providing
personalized health insights by utilizing both local and cloud-based processing. In today’s fast-paced
world, many individuals lack the knowledge and resources to consult with Ayurvedic experts regularly.
There remains a significant gap in the accessibility and personalization of Ayurvedic practices, leading
to a growing demand for easily accessible health insights tailored to individual needs.
2 Proposed Solution
To address this gap, we propose the development of an image and video recognition application that
acts as an online Ayurvedic assistant. This application will allow users to capture images and videos
of their facial and nail characteristics, providing insights based on Ayurvedic principles. By leveraging
advanced image processing techniques, the app will deliver personalized health recommendations, making
Ayurvedic wisdom more accessible to everyone.
3 Technical Solution
Our technical solution involves several key components:
3.1 Technologies Used
• Web Application Development: Next.js for the web user interface, providing Ayurveda experts
with tools to analyze user data.
• Backend Development: Node.js, Go, Flask for backend, handling API requests and data pro-
cessing.
• Database Management: MongoDB Atlas , AWS S3 buckets for storage, AWS sagemaker for
model deployment
3.2 Custom Dataset
To enhance the accuracy of our analysis, we have created a custom dataset that includes details of various
facial and nail characteristics. This dataset is used to train our machine learning models, ensuring they
can accurately identify and analyze the features relevant to Ayurvedic health assessments.
3.3 Model Accuracy
We used Random Forest for image recognition tasks, which are known for their high accuracy in visual
data analysis.

3.4 Optimization of Video Processing
We have implemented optimization techniques for video processing to ensure real-time analysis. This
includes:
• Efficient parsing of video frames to extract relevant features.
• Utilizing lightweight models for on-device processing to minimize latency.
3.5 AI Chat Assistant
To improve user experience, we have integrated an AI chat assistant within the application. This assistant
will:
• Provide users with instant responses to their queries regarding Ayurvedic practices.
• Guide users through the process of capturing images and videos effectively.
• Offer personalized health insights based on the analysis of captured data.
4 Estimated Cost of the Solution
The estimated cost for developing the Health Analysis and Evaluation System is projected to be around
$15 per year which could increase as per scaling of the application . This includes:
• Subscription of AWS S3 and AWS sagemaker if we scale our solution
• Cloud service fee and MongoDB subscription
5 Integration into Daily Life
Imagine a user named Priya, a busy professional who struggles to find time for regular health consul-
tations. With our application, Priya can easily capture her facial and nail images during her morning
routine. The app analyzes her data and provides personalized Ayurvedic insights, such as dietary recom-
mendations and lifestyle changes, all within minutes. Additionally, Ayurveda experts can access this data
through the web application, allowing them to provide tailored health advice based on Priya’s unique
characteristics. This seamless integration allows Priya to take charge of her health without disrupting
her busy schedule, while also supporting Ayurveda experts in delivering personalized care.
6 Potential Risks
While the solution offers significant benefits, it may face several risks:
• Data Privacy Concerns: Users may be hesitant to share personal health data.
• Technical Challenges: Ensuring accurate feature extraction and analysis in diverse lighting and
environmental conditions.
• User Adoption: Convincing users to trust and regularly use the application for health insights.
7 Resource Required
To successfully implement this project, we required these resources:
• Docker to containerize the application for portability.
• Access to cloud services for data storage and processing.
• A dataset of facial and nail images for training our models.
• Machine learning alogrithms like RandomForestRegressor,etc and libraries like opencv,flask,numpy,etc

8 Conclusion
The Health Analysis and Evaluation System aims to bridge the gap in the Ayurvedic sector by providing
an accessible platform for personalized health insights. By leveraging modern technologies such as image
and video recognition, we can empower individuals to take charge of their health while making Ayurvedic
wisdom more widely available as well as Ayurvedic experts to gain insights for personal health.
